# Combining Everything Together

## Summary

We will create a very simple linear classifier in this example.  The data set of interest will be the Iris data.  We will optimize a linear separator between pedal length and pedal width to classify if a flower is _I. setosa_ or not.  The reason we setup the data this way is because it will end up being linear seperable.

## Notes
We use the sigmoid cross entropy loss because we are predicting a binary class (sigmoid) and it is a classification problem (cross entropy).

## Results

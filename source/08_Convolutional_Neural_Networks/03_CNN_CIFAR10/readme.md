CIFAR-10 CNN
============

Here we will build an convolutional neural network to predict the CIFAR-10 data.

The script provided will download and unzip the CIFAR-10 data.  Then it will start training a CNN from scratch.  You should see similar output at the end to the following two graphs.

Here we see the training loss (left) and the test batch accuracy (right).

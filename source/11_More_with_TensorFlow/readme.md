## Ch 11: More with TensorFlow

 1. [Visualizing Computational Graphs (with Tensorboard)](01_Visualizing_Computational_Graphs#visualizing-computational-graphs-wtensorboard)
  * An example of using histograms, scalar summaries, and creating images in Tensorboard.
 2. [Working with a Genetic Algorithm](02_Working_with_a_Genetic_Algorithm#working-with-a-genetic-algorithm)
  * We create a genetic algorithm to optimize an individual (array of 50 numbers) toward the ground truth function.
 3. [Clustering Using K-means](03_Clustering_Using_KMeans#clustering-using-k-means)
  * How to use TensorFlow to do k-means clustering.  We use the Iris data set, set k=3, and use k-means to make predictions.
 4. [Solving a System of ODEs](04_Solving_A_System_of_ODEs#solving-a-system-of-odes)
  * Here, we show how to use TensorFlow to solve a system of ODEs.  The system of concern is the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system.
 5. [Using a Random Forest](05_Using_a_Random_Forest#using-a-random-forest)
  * We illustrate how to use TensorFlow's gradient boosted regression and classification trees.
 6. [Using TensorFlow with Keras](06_Using_TensorFlow_with_Keras#using-tensorflow-with-keras)
  * Here we show how to use the Keras sequential model building for a fully connected neural network and a CNN model with callbacks.

引言
============

We introduce convolutional neural networks (CNN), and how we can use them in TensorFlow.

简单卷积神经网络 (Simple CNNs)
==========================

Here, we show how to create a CNN architecture that performs well on the MNIST digit recognition
task.

高级卷积神经网络 (Advanced CNNs)
============================

In this example, we show how to replicate an architecture for the CIFAR-10 image recognition task.

重新训练一个存在架构
===================================

We show how to download and setup the CIFAR-10 data for the `TensorFlow retraining-fine-tuning tutorial <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/inception>`_

使用Stylenet/Neural-Style
==========================

In this recipe, we show a basic implementation of using Stylenet or Neuralstyle.

运用Deep Dream
=======================

This script shows a line-by-line explanation of TensorFlow's deepdream tutorial. Taken from 
`Deepdream on TensorFlow <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/deepdream>`_
Note that the code here is converted to Python 3.
